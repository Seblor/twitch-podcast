This is an application that allows you to download any twitch VOD in an audio file suitable as a podcast.

# Why ?

Because I like to listen to some Streamer past broadcasts while commuting, and I wanted to get back to Vue development.

Since whipping up the terminal with the software to download those videos every time is not something that's always readily available (for exemple on your phone), I decided to make a web app that does it for me.

# Improvements

- Add a login function to avoid allowing anyone to download files anonymously and hog bandwidth.
- Make the UI prettier
- Switch queue polling to WebSockets
